PHP - The $this Keyword
The $this keyword refers to the current object, and is only available inside methods.

Look at the following example:

Example:
    <?php
        class Fruit {
            public $name;
        }
        $apple = new Fruit();
    ?>
    
So, where can we change the value of the $name property? There are two ways:

1. Inside the class (by adding a set_name() method and use $this):

Example:
    <?php
        class Fruit {
            public $name;
            function set_name($name) {
                $this->name = $name;
            }
        }
        $apple = new Fruit();
        $apple->set_name("Apple");

        echo $apple->name;
    ?>

2. Outside the class (by directly changing the property value):

Example:
    <?php
        class Fruit {
            public $name;
        }
        $apple = new Fruit();
        $apple->name = "Apple";
        
        echo $apple->name;
    ?>
